# O8 - 8-Puzzle Solver

A high-performance 8-puzzle solver in Rust that compares multiple search strategies
in parallel and reports rich statistics. It supports Depth-First Search (DFS),
Breadth-First Search (BFS), and a heuristic best-first/A*-style strategy.

## Overview

The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle consisting of a 3√ó3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them into the empty space. This solver provides a comprehensive analysis of three search algorithms:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper
- **Heuristic (A\*-style)**: Expands states by increasing f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where h(n) is Manhattan distance

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Efficient board representation using compact 32-bit encoding
- üîÑ **Parallel Processing**: Uses Rayon for concurrent puzzle solving
- üìä **Comprehensive Statistics**: Detailed performance metrics and comparison tables
- üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable**: Customizable number of runs and scramble complexity
- üìù **Well Documented**: Extensive rustdoc documentation throughout

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later (uses 2024 edition)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fraco-oxza/o8.git
cd o8
cargo build --release
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a benchmark with default settings (200 runs, 200 scramble steps):

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Subcommands

This binary provides two subcommands: `benchmark` and `solve-random`.

1) Benchmark strategies in parallel and print comparison table:

```bash
# Run 50 tests with 100 scramble moves each
cargo run --release -- benchmark --runs 50 --scramble-steps 100

# Quick test with minimal complexity
cargo run --release -- benchmark --runs 10 --scramble-steps 10

Optional: Fix the number of threads used by Rayon:

```bash
cargo run --release -- benchmark --runs 200 --scramble-steps 200 --threads 8
```

2) Solve a single random board and print the path using a selected algorithm:

```bash
# Heuristic (default)
cargo run --release -- solve-random --scramble-steps 40

# Force DFS or BFS
cargo run --release -- solve-random --algorithm dfs --scramble-steps 40
cargo run --release -- solve-random --algorithm bfs --scramble-steps 40
```
```

### Command Line Options

- `-r, --runs <RUNS>`: Number of test runs to perform for each algorithm (default: 200) [benchmark]
- `-s, --scramble-steps <STEPS>`: Number of scramble steps to generate random puzzle boards (default: 200) [benchmark, solve-random]
- `-t, --threads <N>`: Number of worker threads to use (defaults to Rayon automatic) [benchmark]
- `-a, --algorithm <dfs|bfs|heuristic>`: Algorithm for solve-random (default: heuristic)
- `-h, --help`: Display help information

## Example Output

```
Generating 200 random boards with 200 moves and comparing strategies...

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Board Representation
- **Compact Storage**: 32-bit integer encoding for efficient memory usage and fast operations
- **Implicit Empty Space**: Empty space represented as the missing position in the encoding
- **Hash-Friendly**: Optimized for use in hash tables and sets

#### Search Algorithms
- **Unified Interface**: Common solver interface supporting multiple strategies
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics collection during search
- **Duplicate Detection**: Efficient pruning of already-visited states

#### Statistics Engine
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks 10+ performance indicators
- **Aggregation**: Statistical summaries across multiple runs
- **Formatted Output**: Clean, readable comparison tables

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | DFS | BFS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Solution Quality** | Suboptimal (longer paths) | Optimal (shortest paths) |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower (stack-based) | Higher (queue-based) |
| **Time Complexity** | Variable (can be very slow) | Predictable |
| **Space Complexity** | O(d) where d is depth | O(b^d) where b is branching factor |

## Technical Details

### Board Encoding

The board state is encoded in a compact 32-bit representation where each tile's position is stored using 4 bits. This allows for:
- Fast copying and comparison operations
- Efficient hash table storage
- Minimal memory footprint

#### Encoding Strategy

The key insight is that instead of storing "what tile is at each position", we store "at what position is each tile". This clever approach:

1. **Uses only 32 bits total** (8 tiles √ó 4 bits each = 32 bits)
2. **Makes the empty space implicit** (the position not occupied by any tile)
3. **Enables fast bitwise operations** for moves and comparisons

#### Bit Layout

```text
Bits:  31-28  27-24  23-20  19-16  15-12  11-8   7-4    3-0
Tile:    8      7      6      5      4     3      2      1
Value: pos8   pos7   pos6   pos5   pos4  pos3   pos2   pos1
```

#### Example: Solved State

```text
Board Layout:         Encoding:
1 2 3                Tile 1 at pos 0: 0000
4 5 6                Tile 2 at pos 1: 0001
7 8                  Tile 3 at pos 2: 0010
                     Tile 4 at pos 3: 0011
Positions:           Tile 5 at pos 4: 0100
0 1 2                Tile 6 at pos 5: 0101
3 4 5                Tile 7 at pos 6: 0110
6 7 8                Tile 8 at pos 7: 0111
                     Empty at pos 8:  (implicit)
```

Binary: `01110110010101000011001000010000` = 1985229328

#### Testing the Encoding

You can explore the encoding with the built-in debug utilities:

```bash
cargo test test_solved_board_encoding -- --nocapture
cargo test test_encoding_explanation -- --nocapture
```

This will show you exactly how the bits are arranged and how they change when moves are made.

### Parallel Processing

The solver leverages Rayon for parallel execution:
- Each puzzle instance is solved independently
- Results are collected and aggregated efficiently
- Scales with available CPU cores

### Search Implementation

All strategies share a common framework:
1. Initialize with starting board state
2. Maintain frontier of unexplored states
3. Track parent relationships for solution reconstruction
4. Collect comprehensive statistics during search
