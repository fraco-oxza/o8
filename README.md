# O8 - 8-Puzzle Solver

A high-performance 8-puzzle solver written in Rust that compares the effectiveness of different search strategies (Depth-First Search vs Breadth-First Search) using parallel processing for performance analysis.

## Overview

The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle consisting of a 3√ó3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them into the empty space. This solver provides a comprehensive analysis of two fundamental search algorithms:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Efficient board representation using compact 32-bit encoding
- üîÑ **Parallel Processing**: Uses Rayon for concurrent puzzle solving
- üìä **Comprehensive Statistics**: Detailed performance metrics and comparison tables
- üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable**: Customizable number of runs and scramble complexity
- üìù **Well Documented**: Extensive rustdoc documentation throughout

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later (uses 2024 edition)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fraco-oxza/o8.git
cd o8
cargo build --release
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run with default settings (200 runs, 200 scramble steps):

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Run 50 tests with 100 scramble moves each
cargo run --release -- --runs 50 --scramble-steps 100

# Quick test with minimal complexity
cargo run --release -- --runs 10 --scramble-steps 10
```

### Command Line Options

- `-r, --runs <RUNS>`: Number of test runs to perform for each algorithm (default: 200)
- `-s, --scramble-steps <STEPS>`: Number of scramble steps to generate random puzzle boards (default: 200)
- `-h, --help`: Display help information

## Example Output

```
Generating 200 random boards with 200 moves and comparing DFS vs BFS...

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Board Representation
- **Compact Storage**: 32-bit integer encoding for efficient memory usage and fast operations
- **Implicit Empty Space**: Empty space represented as the missing position in the encoding
- **Hash-Friendly**: Optimized for use in hash tables and sets

#### Search Algorithms
- **Unified Interface**: Common solver interface supporting multiple strategies
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics collection during search
- **Duplicate Detection**: Efficient pruning of already-visited states

#### Statistics Engine
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks 10+ performance indicators
- **Aggregation**: Statistical summaries across multiple runs
- **Formatted Output**: Clean, readable comparison tables

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | DFS | BFS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Solution Quality** | Suboptimal (longer paths) | Optimal (shortest paths) |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower (stack-based) | Higher (queue-based) |
| **Time Complexity** | Variable (can be very slow) | Predictable |
| **Space Complexity** | O(d) where d is depth | O(b^d) where b is branching factor |

## Technical Details

### Board Encoding

The board state is encoded in a compact 32-bit representation where each tile's position is stored using 4 bits. This allows for:
- Fast copying and comparison operations
- Efficient hash table storage
- Minimal memory footprint

### Parallel Processing

The solver leverages Rayon for parallel execution:
- Each puzzle instance is solved independently
- Results are collected and aggregated efficiently
- Scales with available CPU cores

### Search Implementation

Both algorithms share a common framework:
1. Initialize with starting board state
2. Maintain frontier of unexplored states
3. Track parent relationships for solution reconstruction
4. Collect comprehensive statistics during search

## Dependencies

- [`clap`](https://crates.io/crates/clap) - Command-line argument parsing
- [`rand`](https://crates.io/crates/rand) - Random board generation
- [`rayon`](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) - Parallel processing

## Performance Tips

1. **Release Mode**: Always use `--release` for performance testing
2. **Scramble Steps**: Higher values create more complex puzzles but longer solve times
3. **Run Count**: More runs provide better statistical significance
4. **System Resources**: Performance scales with available CPU cores
